# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Tic-Tac-Toe" game in Python. Two players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Installation and Running
### Requirements:
- Python 3.x

### Running the game:
Save the code in a file named `tic_tac_toe.py` and run the following command:
```sh
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Controls
- Players take turns entering a number (1-9) to place their mark (X or O) on the board.
- The numbers correspond to the positions on the 3x3 grid:
  ```
  1 | 2 | 3
  4 | 5 | 6
  7 | 8 | 9
  ```

## Game Rules
- Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".
- The game continues until a player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all spaces are filled (resulting in a draw).
- The game announces the winner when a player achieves victory.
